# Diversity-and-Inclusion-at-Eave
An Open Source Overview of our D&amp;I Inatitives
At Eave, we are deeply committed to improving diversity and inclusion in tech. Not just for ourselves, but for the tech community at large. This is why we have chosen to open source our efforts. We hope that other companies and organizations will be able to find value in some of our efforts, and adopt them for themselves -- and we hope to learn more from others efforts and ideas as well.
